                                GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data
                                is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their
                                personal data. The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the
                                EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers’ data is important irrespective of
                                where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline
                                standard for all our operations worldwide.

                                Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad
                                spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other
                                pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s
                                name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions,
                                genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and
                                ethnicity.

                                <li data-translate="privacyGdprPrinciples4">People covered by the GDPR have the right to

                                GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals'
                                personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by
                                increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's
                                simply the right thing to do. At Ploutoslabs we strongly believe that your data privacy
                                is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that
                                go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.
